For Reporters
----------------------
Before reporting a new issue, please [search existing issues](https://github.com/tagpro-game/tagpro-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue).  Issues that are "in progress" include open issues and closed issues that have been marked "will change/fix/add" or "will consider".  Thanks for helping to make TagPro better!

For Triagers
---------------------

Issues "in progress" can be in one of four states:

 * open: no one has had a chance to review the issue.
 * open ("needs discussion"): someone has looked at it, but we're not sure it is a good idea yet.
 * closed ("will consider"): no more discussion required; we might do it.
 * closed ("will change/fix/add"): no more discussion required; we will do it.
